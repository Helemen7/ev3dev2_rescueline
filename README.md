Python 3 program for Rescue Line with ev3dev2

Because EV3 sucks, functions aren't being used for now.

**Working stuff**:
  - Black and white (proportional) line follower (proportional in debug)

  
**Not working stuff**:
  - Room
  - (Green line follower part) -> Still in implementation

**stable.py**:

  Most consistent program we have, might be a little old but gets the job done (look at stable working stuff)


**debug.py**:

  Newest program, might not work, look at the debug working stuff (Not always going to be there, because of malfunctioning)




**IMPORTANT:**

**PS: The files are not going to be fully functional for a while, so just look at the release notes.**
