Python 3 / Micropython program for Rescue Line with ev3dev2




**stable.py**:
  Most consistent program we have, might be a little old but gets the job done (look at stable working stuff)
- Black and white low quality line follower
- **Yea, that's basically it**


**debug.py**:

  Newest program, might not work, look at the debug working stuff (Not always going to be there, because of malfunctioning)
- Black and white and green high consistency line follower
- Obstacle avoiding

**Still to be implemented**:
- Full room avoiding (EV3 sucks so no Artificial Vision)
- 100% consistency (hard to ever be accomplished)





**IMPORTANT:**

**PS: The files are not going to be fully functional for a while, so just look at the release notes.**
