Python 3 program for Rescue Line with ev3dev2

Because EV3 sucks, functions aren't being used for now.

**Working stuff**:
- Black and white (proportional) line follower
**Not working stuff**:
- Room
- Green line follower part

PS: The files are not going to be fully functional for a while, so just look at the release notes.
